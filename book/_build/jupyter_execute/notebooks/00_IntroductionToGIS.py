# # Introduction to GIS

# ## What is Information? 
# - Information are data that can be understood, usually a sequence of symbols and/or signals with meanings. 
# - Information, in a general sense, is processed, organised and structured data.
# - It provides context for data and enables decision making.
# - Examples: numbers, characters, symbols musical notes, sounds, colors. 

# ## What is Geographic Information? 
# - Any information that contains geographic location; e.g. where is nearest restaurant. 
# - 80% of information has location component(Field in GIS Data by Caitlin Dempsey on October 28, 2021) 

# ## What is System? 
# A collection of linked components that work together for a specific purpose. 
# - Example 1: Car system is composed of engine, wheel, brake components, these components linked together and work for a specific purpose. 
# - Example 2: Human body is composed of organs, tissues, bones and so on. All the components collaborate with each other to support our lives. 

# ## What is GIS(Geographic Information System) 
# A GIS is a **computer-based system** to aid in the collection, maintenance, storage, analysis, display, and distribution of spatial data and information(Bolstad, Chapter 1)

# ## What is Geoscience? 
# - GIScience: The Science behind the GISystem(as tools)
#     - Theoritical foundation on which GIS is based
#     - Addresses the fundamental issues arising from use of geographic information. 
#     - The science is needed to keep the technology moving forward. 
#     
# - Analogy: GIScience is to GIS as scientist is to statistical software packages, or computer science to computer system. 

# ## Research Questions in GIS
# - How can we represent our perception of geographic space in a computer environment?
# - What method can we use to dig deeper in the area of geographic information? 
# - What are the best ways we can visualize the geospatial information to make it easier  to understand?
